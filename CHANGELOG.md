# Changelog

All notable changes to Queue Pilot are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Desktop: no blank strip under the sidebar when the page is scrolled.
- Phones: the page scrolls once instead of twice, so there is no blank space below it, and the top bar stays pinned.
- Phones: the next setup step's button no longer squeezes into a narrow column.

### Added
- Page-view analytics for the deployment's own Vercel dashboard, without cookies.

### Added
- /admin has a People tab: accounts, people active today and this week, and new accounts. Counts only, never names.
- Page-view analytics for the deployment's own Vercel dashboard, without cookies.

### Fixed
- The Docker image starts again: the migration step that runs first now has the database packages it needs.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-29 Security updates

### Security
- undici 8.12.3, the HTTP client behind the guard on feed addresses you add, fixing nine high-severity issues in 7.16.0.
- The MCP SDK, Vercel functions and two packages they pull in (body-parser, zod) moved to versions with their fixes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-29 Security fix and link previews

### Added
- Link previews: shared links to Queue Pilot show its name, a short description and a picture of the week.

### Security
- Next.js 16.4.3, which fixes a critical issue in 16.3.5 (GHSA-2464-fhr4-w9xw).
- The Docker image no longer ships npm or corepack, which the app never uses.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-29 Sign in with Buffer

### Added
- First public version: sign in with Buffer, see the week from your Buffer queue, and write drafts into Buffer with your
  own AI key or the hosted one. Drafts only, and changes only to drafts Queue Pilot wrote.
- Connect shows each AI app you approved with when it last used Queue Pilot, or "approved, not used yet". The setup
  step for your AI counts as done only after an app has really called Queue Pilot.
- Settings shows your security activity: each sign-in with its browser and address, and every AI app you removed.
  Deleting your account deletes this history and keeps only an anonymous record that an account was deleted.
- Connect has setup cards for Claude Code and Codex (commands with a Copy button) and for Cursor (an Add to Cursor
  button that installs the connector in one click).
